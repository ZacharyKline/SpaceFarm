SPACE FARM: A game with contributions Zachary Kline, Matthew Perry, Samantha Kyle, and Dennis Christenson

========================================================

 CONCEPT

========================================================

You're a farmer in space, and need to expand your space farm empire enough to feed the SPACE WHALE at the edge of the galaxy which theatens to swallow your farm space station. The more animals you get the more resources you gain. You can butcher animals for their parts, and then stitch them together using SUPER SCIENCE to create animal abominations, or use the parts to purchase upgrades! Once you've gathered up enough resources and animals, load them into your SPACE CANNON and fire them into the whale's mouth and SAVE YOUR SPACE STATION. With it's hunger sated, it will leave you gifts which will make your life easier next time around.

 ALTAR/MAYBE BUTCHERY?

========================================================

    The altar is a place where you can sacrifice animals to your horrifying space gods for animal parts and blood. Each main animal has 3 - 4 special parts which can be gained from sacrificing them, and you can use those parts to purchase upgrades, use in the laboratory to create specialty animals, or (stretch goal) use the parts to create breeding animals to gain more animals over time.

========================================================

 LABORATORY

========================================================

    The laboratory is where you can create specialty animals using parts from various animals in large quantities and a lot of the universal resource blood to make abominations the likes the world has never seen. These animals and made once, and never can be made again until a reset happens, they provide massive bonuses and (stretch goal?) can be made to level up using even more parts, evolving them into further horrors.
    A list needs to be made for ideas of specialty animals, so that should be a high priority for now until we get it done.

========================================================

 UX OVERHAUL

========================================================

    Lets be honest the game looks bad, we need to fix that. Add animations, maybe subtle sounds that aren't supremely irritating, 

========================================================

 STRETCH GOALS

========================================================

    Below is a list of stretch goals beyond the original scope of the project

========================================================

 BREEDING CENTER

========================================================

    A spot where you can use materials and animals to create breeding versions of the animals which automatically raise the amount of the animals

========================================================

 ACHIEVEMENTS

========================================================

    Everyone loves achievements, it totally isn't a cheap way to incentivize playing much longer than a game warrents. No of course not.
    ANYWAY achievements would basically be for random goals like a certain number of sheep or stuff like that, and get weirder the more you go. Cookie Clicker did it, so why not us. WHY NOT US I ASK YOU?

========================================================

 SAVING USING COOKIES

========================================================

    Something I'm very unfamiliar with, but would be important for the game to have any real staying power.

========================================================

 MORE ANIMALS/UPGRADES/WHATEVER!

========================================================

    Theres a ton more animals and upgrades that could be added.

========================================================

 USE CLASS SYNTAX INSTEAD OF FUNCTIONAL

========================================================

    We're currently using functional javascript for the whole game, but we could alternatively upgrade it to class syntax, or maybe object oriented eventually?

========================================================

 AUTO SACRIFICER

========================================================

    If the breeding center stretch goal is done, I'd like to do a auto sacrificer where you can have a machine or something you purchase (with reset mechanic resources?) where it will automatically kill off your animals at a set rate so you don't have to always manually kill them. This would probably be best implemented if we made it so you could make multiple specialty animals, but might be helpful for the whole leveling them up thing if we decide to do that.
